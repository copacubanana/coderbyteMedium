<p>Using the JavaScript language, have the function DashInsertII(num) insert dashes ('-') 
 between each two odd numbers and insert asterisks ('*') between each two even numbers in 
 str. For example: if str is 4546793 the output should be 454*67-9-3. Don't count zero as 
 an odd or even number. </p>

/*
Steps:
1.  Turn num into a string then split into an array numArr
2.  Loop through, if two elements next to each other are divisible by 2 (EVEN), and is not 0, add to answer
3.  If two elements next to each other are NOT divisible by 2 (ODD), and is not 0, add to answer
4.  If two elements, are either odd or even, add to answer
5.  Add last element of array to answer

function DashInsertII(num) { 
numArr = num.toString().split('');

for (var i = 0; i < numArr.length-1; i++) {

        answer += numArr[i] + '*';
        
    } else if ( numArr[i] % 2 !== 0 && numArr[i+1] % 2 !== 0 && numArr[i] != 0) {
        answer += numArr[i] + '-';
        
    } else {
        answer += numArr[i];
    }    
}

answer += numArr[numArr.length-1];

return answer;

document.write(DashInsertII(99946)); //9-9-94*6 
document.write('<br>');
document.write(DashInsertII(56647304)); //56*6*47-304
document.write('<br>');
document.write(DashInsertII(4546793)); //454*67-9-3

/* Notes 
2/22/16 Solved with steps

Of interest:

numArr[i] !== 0 doesn't work, num Arr[i] is a string, !== type and value
numArr[i] != 0 works

E.g. the operation numArr[i] % 2 == 0, the operation changed the type to Number
