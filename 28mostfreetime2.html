<h1>Coderbyte Challenge: JS: Medium: <br /> 28/33 Most Free Time</h1>

<p> Using the JavaScript language, have the function MostFreeTime(strArr) read the strArr 
parameter being passed which will represent a full day and will be filled with events that
span from time X to time Y in the day.</p>

<p>The format of each event will be hh:mmAM/PM-hh:mmAM/PM. For example, strArr may be 
["10:00AM-12:30PM","02:00PM-02:45PM","09:10AM-09:50AM"].</p>

<p>Your program will have to output the longest amount of free time available between the 
start of your first event and the end of your last event in the format: hh:mm.</p>

<p>The start event should be the earliest event in the day and the latest event should be 
the latest event in the day. The output for the previous input would therefore be 01:30 
(with the earliest event in the day starting at 09:10AM and the latest event ending at 
02:45PM). The input will contain at least 3 events and the events may be out of order.</p>

/* Notes
 3/28/2016 SOLVED YAY!
 Been working on this for a while now.  See 28mostfreetime.html for horror show
 Tried out .exec().. Also, not using !== true etc. for conditions, code looks cleaner
 The flaw is if there are overlapping events, otherwise seems to work ok
